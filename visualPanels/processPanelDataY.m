%   "The DAC0, and DAC1 voltages will be values between 0V – 10V. 
%   The size of the voltage steps is set by the number of frames in X, Y
%   for the current pattern (e.g. 96 frames in one channel would lead to 
%   voltage steps of 10/96 V; frame index 48 would be roughly 5 V). These 
%   outputs are consistent and can be used to recover the exact frame position
%   for patterns of at least 500 frames (can only be done approximately for larger patterns). 
%   These instantaneous pattern positions are essential for off-line analysis of closed-loop behaviors, 
%   and are useful for validating open-loop experimental protocols.
